- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Verify all assets are included
- [ ] Check bundle size and optimize if needed

### Testing
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test with production API URLs

## Deployment

### Backend
1. Set environment variables on hosting platform
2. Deploy backend API first
3. Verify API endpoints are accessible
4. Check logs for any errors
5. Monitor server resources

### Frontend
